%% INFO. Evencodes are used to timestamp behavioral events within the ephys time series.
% This means, behavioral events (stimulus presentation, peaks) are
% generated or expected by Matlab, and either presented or captured by
% external hardware. These events NEED to be precisely represented as a
% time point, to which we can align the neural data afterwards.
%
% These events, to be aligned with neural data, need to me timely defined:
% If we are presenting a stimulus, we need to timestamp the exact moment when
% the stimulus is PRESENTED to the animal in the display, not when it is
% generated in matlab or sent from matlab to the display (there may be delays
% between the ORDER to display and the ACTUAL display). The same way, a
% peak response need to be represented as precise as possible to the ACTUAL
% peak of the animal.
%
% We follow the convention where each event is coded by a single sequence
% of 0s and 1s. For now, a single 1 within a rest of 0s.
%
% This function defines the bit sequences reflecting this convention.

%% INFO. DEUTERON using the exact name that will be provided in the task running script,
    % eventdef.eventName
    % and assign it an unique sequence of 0/1s. The idea is that the event
    % sequence within a trial only needs to change ONE pin at a time, to
    % code for any specific event.
    % After any end of trial code, the pins are needed to set back
    % stepwise to one step away from [0 0 0 0], so when it changes
    % to that, it stamps for the start of the trial.
    % What we need to read is which pin changed (stamped time) and what's
    % the current state of all the other, to get the new word.
    %
    % Example sequence:
    % ...
    % end1      [0 1 0 0] (trial-1 ends with 'omission' flag. Ready to send itiOn.)
    % itiOn     [0 0 0 0] (the trial starts, baseline.)
    % stimOn1   [0 0 0 1] (stimulus is presented, keybuffer opens.)
    % bhv       [0 0 1 1] (a response is registered within allowed time, keybuffer closes.)
    % pun       [1 0 1 1] (the response was incorrect, punishment feedback is sent.)
    % end3      [1 1 1 1] (trial ends with 'incorrect' flag. Not ready to send itiOn.)

%% INFO. INTAN. New way
% Evnts include always the 16 pins, there is no stdEvents and extraEvents, all Events are now
%   espciefied in the defineEvntCodes function. As before the 4 first pins are reserved for fixed
% Evnts (dec 0:15), extra Evnts should be defined independently for each experiment (dec 16 +)
% We are using the names from deuteron to keep the analysis consistent.
% Order of pins in Intan and Deuteron is inverted, dec is always the same, how to read bin is changed
%   the binVec is now calculated as binVec = single(dec2binvec(eventdef.(stdEvents), SETUP.events.pinsLen));
% By default Intan starts with [1 1 0 0 ...] so YOU MUST END each experiment with this Evnt for consistency.
