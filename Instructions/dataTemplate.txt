Folder structure
These are the top-level folders for a completed neurophysiology experiment. The structures of the subfolders is outlined below.
Only if the structure is followed will shared analysis code work for your experiment! 
You can use this template to generate the folder-structure and all files described here. Make sure you follow this format to the point!

1.1 raw
The unprocessed raw-data as collected are stored in raw. For each subject should be one folder subject with its unique subject name. 
All collected data (both electrophysiology or similar data as well as behavioral data) should contain subfolders for each day. 
Folder name is: YYMMDD
If there are multiple recordings of one subject per day append a, b, c... (YYMMDDa).

  \subjectName
   \day
   settings.isf (filetype in case of Intan)

   The Ephys-hardware settings used for recording (if they changed during recording, settings must be included in each 
   day/ directory beginning with the change).

   recordingProtocol.xls

   A record of which electrodes (description and code) were used in each animal/ region. Also the electrode advancement record for each animal/ day (refer to example-file, stick with the foramt since it can be read directly into the analysis pipeline). Generated during recording.


1.2 preprocessing
Filtered and referenced data for Klusta. Can be deleted later. [Not required in our current pipeline.]
Use the same structure for subfolders as in 'raw'.
