"""
Render an Intan .dat excerpt as a spike-sorting video, in sync with its audio.

Two panes:

  * top    - the whole excerpt at a fixed +/-100 uV scale, so ordinary spikes
             fill the pane; anything larger is deliberately clipped. Detected
             events appear as dots at their trough as the playhead reaches them.
  * bottom - every accepted spike waveform, overlaid and accumulating in step
             with the audio, aligned on its trough, with a running mean per
             cluster drawn bold.

Detection: a spike is a negative crossing of -6 sigma (sigma = MAD/0.6745),
taken at the trough, with a 1 ms refractory period. An event is rejected as an
artifact if its waveform also reaches +7 sigma. Accepted troughs are clustered
into large- and small-amplitude groups by 1-D k-means, and coloured separately
when the two groups are genuinely separated.

Audio and video come from the same filtered array in one pass, so they cannot
drift apart. Filtering and file layout are imported from dat_to_audio.py.

Requires ffmpeg on PATH (frames are piped to it as rawvideo).

Examples
--------
    python dat_to_video.py                        # auto-picks a clean window
    python dat_to_video.py amp-A-010.dat --start 2000
    python dat_to_video.py amp-A-010.dat --pos-k 12   # keep big-rebound spikes
